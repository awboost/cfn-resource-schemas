      +  To search for values that include the filter value, use ``CONTAINS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department CONTAINS Security`` matches findings that include the value ``Security`` for the ``Department`` tag. In the same example, a finding with a value of ``Security team`` for the ``Department`` tag is a match.
      +  To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use ``EQUALS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department EQUALS Security`` matches findings that have the value ``Security`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      
      ``CONTAINS`` and ``EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``OR``. A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters ``Department CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance`` match a finding that includes either ``Security``, ``Finance``, or both values.
     To search for values that don't have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
      +  To search for values that exclude the filter value, use ``NOT_CONTAINS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance`` matches findings that exclude the value ``Finance`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      +  To search for values other than the filter value, use ``NOT_EQUALS``. For example, for the ``ResourceTags`` field, the filter ``Department NOT_EQUALS Finance`` matches findings that don’t have the value ``Finance`` for the ``Department`` tag.
      
      ``NOT_CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``AND``. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters ``Department NOT_CONTAINS Security AND Department NOT_CONTAINS Finance`` match a finding that excludes both the ``Security`` and ``Finance`` values.
      ``CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``CONTAINS`` filters. ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters.
     You can’t have both a ``CONTAINS`` filter and a ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can’t have both an ``EQUALS`` filter and a ``NOT_EQUALS`` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
      ``CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_CONTAINS`` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *User Guide*.

export type StringFilter = {
  /**
     * The condition to apply to a string value when filtering Security Hub findings.
     To search for values that have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
      +  To search for values that include the filter value, use ``CONTAINS``. For example, the filter ``Title CONTAINS CloudFront`` matches findings that have a ``Title`` that includes the string CloudFront.
      +  To search for values that exactly match the filter value, use ``EQUALS``. For example, the filter ``AwsAccountId EQUALS 123456789012`` only matches findings that have an account ID of ``123456789012``.
      +  To search for values that start with the filter value, use ``PREFIX``. For example, the filter ``ResourceRegion PREFIX us`` matches findings that have a ``ResourceRegion`` that starts with ``us``. A ``ResourceRegion`` that starts with a different value, such as ``af``, ``ap``, or ``ca``, doesn't match.
      
      ``CONTAINS``, ``EQUALS``, and ``PREFIX`` filters on the same field are joined by ``OR``. A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters. For example, the filters ``Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS CloudWatch`` match a finding that includes either ``CloudFront``, ``CloudWatch``, or both strings in the title.
     To search for values that don’t have the filter value, use one of the following comparison operators:
      +  To search for values that exclude the filter value, use ``NOT_CONTAINS``. For example, the filter ``Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront`` matches findings that have a ``Title`` that excludes the string CloudFront.
      +  To search for values other than the filter value, use ``NOT_EQUALS``. For example, the filter ``AwsAccountId NOT_EQUALS 123456789012`` only matches findings that have an account ID other than ``123456789012``.
      +  To search for values that don't start with the filter value, use ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS``. For example, the filter ``ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS us`` matches findings with a ``ResourceRegion`` that starts with a value other than ``us``.
      
      ``NOT_CONTAINS``, ``NOT_EQUALS``, and ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters on the same field are joined by ``AND``. A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters. For example, the filters ``Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch`` match a finding that excludes both ``CloudFront`` and ``CloudWatch`` in the title.
     You can’t have both a ``CONTAINS`` filter and a ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filter on the same field. Similarly, you can't provide both an ``EQUALS`` filter and a ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filter on the same field. Combining filters in this way returns an error. ``CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``CONTAINS`` filters. ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters can only be used with other ``NOT_CONTAINS`` filters.
     You can combine ``PREFIX`` filters with ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the ``PREFIX`` filters, and then the ``NOT_EQUALS`` or ``PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS`` filters.
     For example, for the following filters, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either ``AwsIam`` or ``AwsEc2``. It then excludes findings that have a resource type of ``AwsIamPolicy`` and findings that have a resource type of ``AwsEc2NetworkInterface``.
      +   ``ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam``
      +   ``ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2``
      +   ``ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy``
      +   ``ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface``
      
      ``CONTAINS`` and ``NOT_CONTAINS`` operators can be used only with automation rules. For more information, see [Automation rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/automation-rules.html) in the *User Guide*.
